# ML_notes

These are some of my notes studying machine learning. My primary aim is to use this repository to develop my intuition around basic ML concepts such as activation functions, loss functions, initialization of parameters, or optimization methods. I am publishing these notes here in on the off chance that somebody might find some of it helpful. However, to any visitor, I would thoroughly recommend to go through Andrew Ng's excellent deep learning specialization (https://www.deeplearning.ai/) as well as Stanford's CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/). The content of this repo relies heavily on both these sources.
